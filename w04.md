# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [What is a Bit? & A Byte? â€“ A Helpful Guide In Simple Words](https://www.8bitmen.com/what-is-a-bit-a-byte-a-deep-dive/)<br>
Like the title, this website guides us to know about bit and byte. In a short, a byte is a collection of 8 bits. But have you ever wondered why 8 bits? read more about bits and bytes here.

2. [C Pointers](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-pointers)<br>
Pointers are powerful features of C. In this website, we can learn about pointers; what pointers are, how do we use them and the common mistakes we might face when working with them with the help of examples.

3. [Data Processing In Computer](https://peda.net/kenya/ass/subjects2/computer-studies/form-3/data-processing)<br>
This website tells us about data processing cycle and methods, along with the examples of each method and advantages-disadvantages. It also tells us about data integrity, including threats to them and ways of minimizing the threats.

4. [What Is Address Binding?](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-address-binding)<br>
Computer memory uses both logical addresses and physical addresses. Address binding allocates a physical memory location to a logical pointer by associating a physical address to a logical address, which is also known as a virtual address. Read more about address binding here.

5. [Static vs Dynamic libraries](https://medium.com/@birnbera/static-vs-dynamic-libraries-5912efe9bf52)<br>
It's about static and dynamic libraries and their differences. Each of them has their own benefits and drawbacks. It also tells us how to make dynamic library, how it works differently on different operating systems, and how to use a shared library in a program.

6. [Contiguous Memory Allocation](https://www.techslang.com/definition/what-is-contiguous-memory-allocation/)<br>
This website tells us what is Contiguous Memory Allocation, that is a way to allocate adjacent parts of memory to a process or file that needs it. Since all of the available partitions of the memory space are in the same place, the unused sections are not distributed randomly. It also tells us how does contiguous memory allocation differ from non-contiguous one and how does it work, along with the illustration.

7. [First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit in OS](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/first-fit-best-fit-worst-fit-in-os-example/)<br>
System uses different algorithms to allocate memory from the main memory segment. These algorithms, also known as the memory partitioning algorithms, are generally categorized into three, first fit, best fit, and worst fit. The website is telling us each category with examples. It also provides us some codes in C, C++, Java, and Python for each algorithm.

8. [Memory Management QnA](https://www.sanfoundry.com/operating-system-mcqs-memory-management-paging-1/)<br>
This site is providing us some questions about memory management. There are 15 questions and also each answer so we could check how well we know about memory management. So let's check yours!

9. [Swapping in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/swapping-in-operating-system)<br>
Swapping is a memory management scheme in which any process can be temporarily swapped from main memory to secondary memory so that the main memory can be made available for other processes. This website mainly talks about the concept of swapping. There are also example, advantages, and disadvantages of swapping.

10. [Structure of Page Table](https://binaryterms.com/structure-of-page-table.html)<br>
Paging is a memory management technique where a large process is divided into pages and is placed in physical memory which is also divided into frames. Frame and page size is equivalent. The operating system uses a page table to map the logical address of the page generated by CPU to its physical address in the main memory. There are three common methods that we can use to structure a page table, such as Hierarchical Page Table, Hashed Page Table, and Inverted Page Table with each illustration.
