# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Crash Course: Files & File Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM)<br>
I easily attracted with video with good animation and when I search about file system in youtube then I got this video. The video tells us about how our computer read and interpret computer files. It also discussed how some popular file formats like txt, wave, and bitmap are encoded and decoded from just strings of 1’s and 0’s. And lastly about how our computers are able to keep all this data organized and readily accessible to users.

2. [What is Metadata?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc0pXCh-2bE)<br>
It's a 5 minutes video about metadata, like what is metadata, why does it matter, and what can we do from it. The conversation sounds light because the speaker presents it with easy-to-understand example. He also tells us what we should think about when we use metadata.

3. [mmap, memory mapped file io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7E9piHcfr4)<br>
This video is abou thow to map files into memory in C. The speaker tells that it is the coolest way to read and write files that nobody knows about as his prologue in the video so I just continue watch this because I personally became curious. He also show us the difference between using mmap and fopen/fseek.

4. [Introduction to mounting filesystems in Linux](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/introduction-to-mounting-filesystems-in-linux/)<br>
This website tells us what does it mean by mounting a filesystem and why do we need to do it. Appart from that, it also tells us how to mount filesystem and how to see a list of mounted filesystem. It contains several commands that we can use along with the explaination.

5. [Overview of Linux Journaling Filesystems](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=26153&seqNum=3)<br>
Though the title is just 'overview' but this website is more complete that I expected. First it tells us what is journaling filesystem along with the analogy that helps us understand. Then we got know about the contents of journaling filesystem log, weher log are stored, to verifying the consistency of a journaling filesystem.

6. [Writing your own file system is easier than you think](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/writing-your-own-file-system-is-not-as-hard-as-you-may-think-aa4af09329cd)<br>
In the cloud computing era, distributed storage systems are pervasive. But have you ever thought of how they store data internally? The answer is obviously non-uniform, but let them tell you the adventure they had in designing how the fastest and most scalable deduplicating backup appliance in the world was going to do that. Their descriptions is also interesting to read and look.

7. [File organization methods](https://peda.net/kenya/css/subjects/computer-studies/form-three/driac2/data-processing/fom)<br>
This website tells us foru methods of organizing files and each advantages also disadvantages. They don't have much explanations but more in points.

8. [Why every programmer should learn C](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/why-every-programmer-should-learn-c)<br>
What I got from this website is learning C is like we have to dig down into the flour and get our hands dusty when we make our own bread, but you end up understanding the process at an intimate level. With this analogy, it tells us more about advantages we could get while learning C and its explanation. When we learn to program in C we almost have to gain an understanding of how programs execute.

9. [Develop your own filesystem with FUSE](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/linux/articles/l-fuse/)<br>
This website tells us what is FUSE and how to develop a filesystem with it. There are some requirements we need to have but they explain it well. The example from every step is also clear.

10. [printf, fprintf, dprintf, sprintf, snprintf, vprintf, vfprintf, vdprintf](https://www.math-linux.com/man/man3/printf.3.html)<br>
When I try to run demo3, I was confused because there are few types of printf. This website tells us about these functions and things related to it, like flag characters, field width, precision, length modifier, conversion specifier, etc. There are some notes and examples too to help us understand.
