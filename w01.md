# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeOBEOBJREs)<br>
This video is telling us what is virtual memory and how does it work in a minute.
Though only a minute, but it gives me a brief description to know what virtual memory is in short.
There are also advantages and disadvantages when we use virtual memory.
So I think that short video like this can be important sometimes to take notes of the main idea of this topic.

2. [Paging and Virtual Memory](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/hardware/paging-and-segmentation/#:~:text=Paging%20and%20segmentation%20are%20processes,data%20needs%20a%20storage%20address.)<br>
The site is about the explainations of paging, and some technical terms that related to it.
Starts with the definition, process, to advantages and disadvantages.

3. [Virtualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR0rG3HKIk)<br>
Another video resources that I got from youtube but now it's about virtualization.
The video is telling us what is virtualization, more about the the core of virtualization as a process,
including hypervisor and benefits we can get.

4. [Five Types of Virtualizations](https://www.globalknowledge.com/us-en/resources/resource-library/articles/virtualization-for-newbies-five-types-of-virtualization/#gref)<br>
More about virtualization, I searched for its types and found this website.
The title is "Virtualizations For Newbie" so I just clicked it, and there they tell us about five types of virtualizations, such as dekstop virtualization, application virtualization, server virtualization, 
storage virtualization, and network virtualization, and also a little about its evolution.

5. [Cloud Services](https://proxsisgroup.com/apa-itu-cloud-service/#:~:text=Cloud%20service%20merupakan%20istilah%20yang,infrastruktur%20maupun%20perangkat%20keras%20internal.)<br>
This website is telling us about what is cloud service, 
how does it work, the advantages, and the explaination of few kinds of cloud services, 
like SaaS, IaaS, PaaS. There are also types of cloud services based on who needs it,
whether it's for public, private, or both. 

6. [Hypervisor](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/hypervisor#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20main%20hypervisor,system%2C%20like%20other%20computer%20programs.)<br>
This website explains what hypervisor is, types of hypervisor (bare metal and hosted), how does it work,
the benefits (like speed, efficiency, flexibility, portability), and also differences between container and hypervisor.

7. [Pros and Cons of Virtualization](https://www.hitechnectar.com/blogs/pros-cons-virtualization/)<br>
Unlike the previous resources I get about virtualization, this site is specifically discussing about the pros and cons of virtualizations. The world of IT is actively venturing into virtualization more than ever, but not everything as rosy as it seems, so there are also advantages and disadvantages of it.

8. [Elasticity](https://solutionsreview.com/cloud-platforms/what-is-elasticity-and-how-does-it-affect-cloud-computing/)<br>
This site mainly tells us about how elasticity affects cloud computing, or cloud elasticity, and the difference between that and cloud scalability.

9. [Learn regex](https://dev.to/ziishaned/learn-regex-the-easy-way-c4g)<br>
This is another resources I got to learn regex beside the notes and sources I got from class. The contents is almost the same, but the explaination and examples are not, so maybe this can be another source for me to learn regex.

10. [Vi and Vim](https://www.shell-tips.com/linux/vi-vs-vim/#:~:text=Vi%20stands%20for%20Visual.,Vi%20standard%20with%20many%20additions.)<br>
Basically this site tells us about vi and vim and how they different with each other. There are also some informations about features of both.
