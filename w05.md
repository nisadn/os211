# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [How computer memory works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q5zWCw8J4)<br>
Like the title, this video tells us how computer memory works on our computer. It says that our memories helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future. And for the computers, memory plays much the same role. This video also provides great animation to help us understand.

2. [Should You Leave Your Computer On All the Time?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngGm78FyIBY)<br>
I was scrolling on my youtube and suddenly got this video. This question is really related to me right at the moment because assignments from all class is like looping every week. The one who losing sleep is not just me but also my computer :D or I just overslept while my laptop is still on.

3. [Why do CPUs Need Caches?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JpLD3PUAZk)<br>
This video tells us what is cache, the use of caches, and how it works on the computer. It also provides us some analogies, illustrations, and most importantly good explanation.

4. [Will More RAM Make your PC Faster??](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUFWalEf31w&t=7s)<br>
Do we really need a really big RAM to have a high resolution gaming or 4K video editing? When we ask about how much do we need, as always the answer is, it depends. In this video, they tested a variety od workloads to compare. See more on this video about the details.

5. [Thrashing in OS](https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/02/thrashing-in-operating-system-os.html)<br>
When a program need space larger than RAM, the OS will try to allocate space from secondary memory and behaves like it has that much amount of memory by serving to that program or we call it as virtual memory. To know about thrashing we first need to know what is page fault and swapping, so they tell us about that first and then about thrashing, the effects of thrashing, and techniques to handle thrashing.

6. [Virtual Memory in OS: What is, Demand Paging, Advantages](https://www.guru99.com/virtual-memory-in-operating-system.html)<br>
This website contains many topics, not only virtual memory in general. Starts with the introduction about the virtual memory itself, why we need it, and how it works along with the examples. Then entering to demand paging, about what is demand paging, types of demand paging and each explanation, how it works, and also its advantages-disadvantages.

7. [Allocating kernel memory (buddy system and slab system)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocating-kernel-memory-buddy-system-slab-system/)<br>
It contains explanations about two strategies for managing free memory that is assigned to kernel processes, such as buddy system and slab system. Mainly discusses about each definition, types, why we use it, example, advantages, and disadvantages.

8. [What are the Page Replacement Algorithms?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-the-page-replacement-algorithms)<br>
This website introduces us the concept of page replacement, which is used in memory management. It tells us the definition, need, and various algorithms related to page replacement with each examples and illustration to help us understand.

9. [Windowsâ€™s Virtual Address Space: A Short MSDN Story](https://www.tenouk.com/WinVirtualAddressSpace.html)<br>
Here they tell us about virtual address space and physical storage, page state, scope of allocated memory, memory protection, copy-on-write protection, and some other subtopics.

10. [Virtual Memory In a Comic](https://wizardzines.com/comics/virtual-memory/)<br>
Just want to chill out and freshen my mind while searching my weekly top 10 list. This time is a comic about virtual memory. The drawing somehow look interesting to me. The main idea of virtual memory can still be delivered through the drawing and gives me an overview about it.
