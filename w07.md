# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Process Synchronization in Operating System](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/process-synchronization/)<br>
This website generally tells us about what is synchronization, types of synchronization, why is it important, how to solve the situation, and the solutions. At the end of the page, there are also few links that you could see to learn more about these topics specifically.

2. [Semaphores for Process Synchronization](https://dextutor.com/semaphores-for-process-synchronization/)<br>
Like the title, this site tells us about the usage of semaphores in process synchronization. I think the explanation is good. They also tells us about problems with using semaphores, the solution, and provide us with some examples.

3. [Bounded Buffer Problem or Producer Consumer Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/bounded-buffer)<br>
Bounded buffer problem is one of the classic problems of synchronization. But do you know that bounded buffer problem is also called producer consumer problem? and why is that? So let's start by understanding the problem here, then moving on to the solution and program code that has been provided.

4. [Mutex vs Semaphore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutex-vs-semaphore/)<br>
What is the difference between a mutex and a semaphore? When should you use a mutex and when should you use a semaphore? This site probably might answer your question about it and even the misconseption between them. There are also written some frequently asked questions and the answers about mutex and semaphore.

5. [Peterson’s Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
Peterson’s Algorithm is one of the solution of critical section problem. This website contains explanation, code example, and shows us the output to help us get the overview or idea about this algorithm.

6. [What is Deadlock and what are its four necessary conditions?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-deadlock-and-what-are-its-four-necessary-conditions)<br>
In this blog, we will learn about Deadlock. We will find what a Deadlock is and see the four necessary conditions of Deadlock that are also known as Coffman conditions and these conditions are not mutually exclusive. Beside, this blog contains explanation about difference between Deadlock and Starvation.

7. [What are Deadlock handling techniques in Operating System?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-deadlock-handling-techniques-in-operating-system)<br>
After we know what deadlock is, now we will learn about deadlock handling techniques. To remove deadlock from our system, we need to avoid any one of four conditions of deadlock. So, there are various ways of deadlock handling. Check it out to see them one by one.

8. [What is Banker’s algorithm?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-bankers-algorithm)<br>
Banker’s Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm. It is also used for deadlock detection. This website contains the exlanation of the algorithm and also provided us with an example.

9. [The Dining Philosopher’s Problem](https://medium.com/swlh/the-dining-philosophers-problem-bbdb92e6b788)<br>
This website mainly tells us about dining philosopher's problem, a very well known resource sharing problem in the world of computers. I think the explanations are great with the analogy of 5 philosophers sitting around a round table eating spaghetti and each of them has one chopstick between them, and of course with illustration.

10. [Synchronization and Deadlock Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/207751019/)<br>
Got a quizlet for this week's topics, about synchronization and deadlock. Actually there are many other quizlet sets, but I chose this one because the topics are combined while others are separate, and I think that the keyword selection is good.
