# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling: Key Differences](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)<br>
This site contains explanation about preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling, their differences, each advantages-disadvantages, and also the examples. I think they delivered the topics well and I found it helpful with the examples along with good illustrations.

2. [Process scheduling algorithms in OS](https://afteracademy.com/blog/process-scheduling-algorithms-in-the-operating-system)<br>
In a system, there are a number of processes that are present in different states at a particular time. Some processes may be in the waiting state, others may be in the running state and so on. CPU uses some kind of process scheduling algorithms to select one process for its execution amongst so many processes. In this blog, we will learn about those algorithms used by CPU to schedule a process.

3. [What is Burst time, Arrival time, Exit time, Response time, Waiting time, Turnaround time, and Throughput?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-burst-arrival-exit-response-waiting-turnaround-time-and-throughput)<br>
When we are dealing with some CPU scheduling algorithms, there are some confusing terms like Burst time, Arrival time, Exit time, Waiting time, Response time, Turnaround time, and throughput. These parameters are used to find the performance of a system. So, let's get to know them one by one.

4. [Difference between Scheduler and Dispatcher](https://afteracademy.com/blog/difference-between-scheduler-and-dispatcher)<br>
In this blog, we will learn the difference between a scheduler and a dispatcher. Don't worry if you don't know what dispatcher is, because there are quick overview about dispatcher in the beginning of the page. 

5. [Difference between User Level and Kernel Level Thread](https://alldifferences.net/difference-between-user-level-and-kernel-level-thread/)<br>
This website tells us about user level and kernel level thread in points, their differences, and also each advantages and disadvantages. The main topic of this website is the differences and they show it though comparison chart. I think this website is suitable for those who seek a summary-like information about this topic.

6. [Relationship between User level thread and Kernel level thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/relationship-between-user-level-thread-and-kernel-level-thread/)<br>
From the previous website, we knew the differences between user level and kernel level thread. But it turns out that there is a strong a relationship between them. What is it? Find out the answers here.

7. [What is Long-Term, Short-Term, and Medium-Term Scheduler?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-long-term-short-term-and-medium-term-scheduler)<br>
Schedulers are responsible for transferring a process from one state to the other. Basically, there are three types of schedulers, such as long-term, short-term, and medium-term scheduler. This blog contains explanation about these schedulers, difference between them, and where these schedulers are placed in the Process State Diagram. So let's check it out!

8. [Scheduling in Real Time Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/)<br>
In real-time systems, the scheduler is considered as the most important component which is typically a short-term task scheduler. The main focus of this scheduler is to reduce the response time associated with each of the associated processes instead of handling the deadline. The scheduling algorithm can be classified based  on schedulability, implementation (static or dynamic), and the result (self or dependent) of analysis. Read more here.

9. [Multilevel Queue Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/multilevel-queue-scheduling)<br>
This website tells us about multilevel queue schedulling, where the ready queue partitioned into several separate queues based on some property of the process and each queue has its own scheduling algorithm. This web also provide us with some examples and the advantages-disadvantages of multilevel queue schedulling.

10. [Quizlet : Scheduling (flashcards, games, tests, etc.)](https://quizlet.com/234152615/)<br>
This web provides you fun ways to learn about theoritical things and this week I searched for scheduling as the topic. There are some modes you can choose, such as flashcards, games, and tests, according to your preferences to learn. Some of the flashcards just for premium account, but the games and tests are free. I suggest this web because enjoying what we're doing can make us learn faster.
